## Coca - Cola drunk in one day

*Question*: How many coca cola drinks are consumed in a day in the United States?

Coca cola is a sugary drink which is taken on a recreational basis or with food for fun. There are approximately 330 million people in the USA.  Breaking down the population figures by 5 generations of roughly 20 years.
| Generation | Population breakdown	|Population	|Coke drinking population	|Multiplier	|Cokes drunk daily |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
|0-20|	15%	|49,500,000|	37125000|	3X|	111375000|
|21-40|	20%	|66,000,000 |	33000000|	2X|	66000000|
|41-60|	20%|	66,000,000|	19800000|	1X|	19800000|
|61-80|	20%|	66,000,000| 	6600000 |	1X |	6600000|
|80-100+|	25%|	82,500,000|	0| 0|	0 |

Total cokes drunk daily in the United States **203,775,000**

**Assumptions**:
US is a developed economy, with an aging population pyramid.
Children from the age of 5 drink coke, due to the high sugar content younger age groups are likely to drink coke more and more often. As people age they tend to become more health conscious and reduce their consumption of unhealthy drinks. Beyond 80+ years of age, coke will become too risky (diabetes, cholesterol or other ailments) to take on a reasonable basis hence nobody of the age group is consuming it.
Kids love to drink coke and will take it multiple times a day, young adults will order a lot of their meals and take coke 2 times. The others only take coke occasionally or once a day.

## Refridgerators in USA
*Question*:How many refrigerators are in the United States.

*Answer*:

A refrigerator is a device which is used to keep perishables fresh or safe. They often come with freezers equipped. There are many kinds of refrigerators including medical grade devices used to store medicine, etc. For practicality reasons we will be considering the common refrigerators used in homes. 
It makes sense to tackle this problem by breaking down the household by the income level, as a household’s affluence influences how many refrigerators owned.

*Assumptions*:
Let there be three income levels High, Middle, low. There are roughly 110 million households in the USA.
The high income portion is roughly 20% , middle income is roughly 50%, with the remaining 30% being low income.
Rich households probably have more than one refrigerator in their home. They could have multiple kitchens,etc so I will assume they have roughly 4 per household.
The middle-income households have 2 fridges. The lower income households can’t afford to have multiple fridges so let us assume that they have 1 fridge each.

| Affluence	| Number Households	| Number per home	| Total |
| ------------- || ------------- || ------------- || ------------- |
| High |	22000000| 4 |	88000000 |
| Middle | 55000000| 2 | 110000000|
| Low |	33000000 |1 |	33000000 |
 Total: 231,000,000.00

There are roughly 231 million refrigerators in the USA.
For the other locations such as clinics, nursing homes, hospitals, retirement homes, community centers, etc you can add an estimate 10 million to the above.
That’s a total of roughly 241 million refrigerators in USA.
