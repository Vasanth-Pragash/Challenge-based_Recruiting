# Cemex case study

**Interviewer**: Our client is CEMEX a large cement manufacturing company based in Mexico but with its primary market in the USA.  Its revenue for 2022 was $15.5 billion dollars. The client has an issue with profitability, and has made large losses in the recent past. The board has hired a new CEO, and they want to turn things around.

**Interviewee**: I have a few clarification questions before we proceed. What constitutes success in the clients eye? Are there any other objectives besides profitability.

**Interviewer**: The CEO wants to maintain an EBITDA margin of around 20% which is inline with the competitors. There are no other objectives besides profitability.

**Interviewee**: OK. I would like to ask some questions about the company and competitive landscape to determine the issue.
What are the various products the company offers and what are the contributions to its overall revenue? Who are the companies primary customers?

**Interviewer**: The company has primarily 4 product categories. Cement contributing 42%, ready-mix 33%, aggregates 14%, urban solutions 11%. 
Our customer segments are:
1.	Companies working on large infrastructure products
2.	Heavy construction
3.	Light construction
Their breakdown is:

**Interviewee**:
That’s interesting  the primary use case is infrastructure, whose spending across the globe has been volatile since interest rates have started going up across the globe. It will be interesting to see how the mix has changed over time. Before proceeding with the assessment is there an industry wide slowdown , and what is the market share of the client?

**Interviewer**: Yes there is an industry wide slowdown due to cut backs in global infrastructure spending and the client is the second largest player in the United States with a market share of around 35%.
**Interviewee**: This is interesting, id like to focus on the revenue and cost drivers for the company. The analysis can be broken down into:

Can you provide the revenue and cost breakdown for the client?

**Interviewer**: We do not have the pricing data from the client, and in any case, they are a market chaser and not a market maker.  This is the breakdown for costs:

We can clearly see that fixed costs significantly drive the cost perspective.
As we know that the client has a volatile earnings scenario, we cannot change the prices and there is a global macro-economic slowdown, would the client be willing to sell unprofitable divisions(or under utilized) to reduce the losses and reduce shrinkage?

**Interviewer**: The client may be willing to do this, can you provide a summary of the risks and benefits?

**Interviewee**:

Risks:
1.	A possible risk is that the global economy may rebound which may leave Cemex unable to scale up demand.
2.	Market share may further erode.
3.	There may be pre existing contracts that limit how quickly certain divsions can be closed down, this could cause issues and may need negotiating
4.	The dissolution may not go smoothly and could lead to a loss in productivity and blowback
Benefits:
1.	Sale of weak division will generate cash which can be re distributed to more profitable segments and investors which can improve Cemex brand value and valuation
2.	Companies’ liquidity position will improve as it no longer needs to pay high amount of fixed costs
