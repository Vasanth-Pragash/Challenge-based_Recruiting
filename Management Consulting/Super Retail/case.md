## Introduction:

**Interviewer**: Welcome to the case interview. Our client is Super retail a large retail store that sells a variety of merchandise from Groceries to Electronics. We have been tasked with helping the electronics division. The division which was previously the best performing division has recently been posting huge losses. The client has hired a new operations manager who needs to turnaround the division. The manager has hired us to provide recommendations.

**Candidate**: Great, I have some quick clarifying questions before we proceed.
1.	What constitutes success in the client’s eye? Are there any other non-financial objectives that need to be kept in mind.
2.	Is the client a market leader or market participant?
3.	Have the competitors’ profits also fallen?

**Interviewer**: Ok
1.	The client wants the division back on track and to be profitable again.
2.	The client would like to retain their brand identity and quality, so they don’t want any changes that could negatively affect their reputation.
3.	The client is a market leader in this segment. 
4.	No, the competitors profits have not fallen.

**Interviewer**: "Let's begin by analyzing the revenue and cost figures for Super Retail Inc. What insights can you draw from the data provided, and how might these factors be affecting our profitability?"
 |---|Year 1|	Year 2|
 |---|---|---|
|Revenue|	100 million|	103.5 million|
|Customer lifetime value|	$500| $500 |
|Sales volume|	400,000 units|	460,000 units|
|Average price per unit|	250	|225|
|Variable cost per unit|	150|	180|
|Fixed costs| ---  |   --- |	 	 
|- Rent|	10 million|	13 million|
|- Staff Overhead|	15 million|	17.25 million|
|-Loan Interest|	5 million|	5 million|
|- Marketing|	10 million|	14 million|
|Logistics|	8 million|	10 million |

**Candidate**: "Certainly. Initially, we can calculate the gross profit for both years to see the effect of changes in sales volume, price per unit, and variable costs. Let’s perform the calculations."
•	Year 1 Gross Profit: (400,000 units * $250) - (400,000 units * $150) = $100M - $60M = $40M.
•	Year 2 Gross Profit: (460,000 units * $225) - (460,000 units * $180) = $103.5M - $82.8M = $20.7M.
That is a significant decline of around 51.75% Year on year.

**Interviewer**: Indeed, that's quite concerning. Anything else?
**Candidate**:  
Yes, when we incorporate fixed costs into the mix, we get the net profit. The decline becomes more pronounced.
With the increase in fixed costs, particularly rent and staff overhead, the net profit for both years would be:
•	Year 1 Net Profit: $32M - ($10M + $15M + $5M + 10M) = $40M - $40M = No profit.
•	Year 2 Net Profit: $10.7M - ($13M + $17.25M + $5M +14M) = $20.7M - $49.25M = Loss of $28.55M.
The client has begun making huge losses.

### Part 1: Analysis of fixed costs
**Interviewer**: Yes indeed. What do you think should be done?

**Candidate**:  I would like to focus on the cost side as it’s clear that takes out a significant chunk of revenue, then I would also like to evaluate the revenue side to find ways to improve there as well.
First starting with the costs, do you have any other information about the fixed costs?

**Interviewer**: 
Sure:
1.	Our client has rented a new warehouse in the center of the city for their lightning delivery policy. Management had decided on this expansion as they felt it could help them handle logistics more easily and cut delivery times by 50%. Approximately a 10% increase can be attributed to this new warehouse alone.
2.	The new warehouse requires hiring more employees, however the company recently over hired in the past, so they were able to reallocate personnel. The company didn’t have enough resources to supervise so they were forced to hire qualified supervisors at a hefty premium to the market rate.
3.	We are paying $ 5 million each year for a large expansion loan we took in the past. We have about 3 years left of payments to make.
4.	We have an aggressive marketing campaign that involves door to door marketing, newspaper advertising and billboards that promote awareness of our products to customers. This has led to an increase in marketing costs by 40% totaling at $14 million.

**Candidate**: That’s interesting. I’d like to look more in detail at the warehouse, the clients lightning delivery promise and the aggressive marketing but I can see one potential way to reduce costs in the interest rate payments.
You have mentioned that the loan was acquired many years in the past, but recently the interest rates have drastically fallen and are around 1%. Would the client be able to borrow fresh money at a lower interest rate and revolve on the older loan?
**Interviewer**: That’s interesting. The total loan amount on our books is roughly 11 million, and the interest rate we pay is roughly 3%.

**Candidate**: 
Loan amount = 11
New Interest rate = 1%
Tenure = 3 years
Yearly interest payments = (11 * (1.01) ^3) / 3 = 3.7 million
That’s wonderful, the client could borrow 11 million at 1%, close off the old loan and instead repay the new one at 3.7 million a year for 3 years. Which is a savings of about $1.3 million a year, without an increase in debt level.

Going back to fixed costs can you tell me a more about the client’s:
1.	Lightning delivery program, what is the standard delivery time and how much we are reducing under the program. Are we collecting any premiums for this program and do our competitors offer similar schemes?
2.	What is the present utilization of the new warehouse? Do we have spare capacity in the other warehouses nearby of similar volume? Were those warehouses used prior to the implementation of lightning?

**Interviewer**: That’s a significant saving, but the client will need to contact their bank to confirm the interest rates.
To answer your questions:
1.	The lightning delivery program guarantees a customer gets his electronic items within 30 minutes of placing the order. Prior to the implementation of the program, delivery times averaged about 1 hour. This is a unique feature the client provides that competitors do not have. We do not collect any extra charges for this service, and regular costs apply.
2.	All our warehouses are of the same capacity.  As the incentive is very new, only around 5% of the new warehouse is being utilized.  There are other warehouses nearby that are used to service the same customers but for products without the lightning guarantee. Those warehouses are currently at 80% capacity.

**Candidate**: Ok from what I understand this is a unique service the client provides but doesn’t charge a premium for this service. Additionally, this feature is quite new and hasn’t gained much traction.
Would the client be willing to remove the lightning program? This program only reduces delivery time by 50% but increases the rent by a whopping 10% or 1.1 million. 
As the client is already a market leader, and nobody else provides this service it can be withdrawn to save a lot of money.  The client should consider exiting the lease on the new warehouse.
Additionally, as the products being sold are electronics, can an assumption be made that those buying them are fairly tech savvy and are young or potentially have young people in their household to help them out?
In that case I don’t think door to door marketing, newspaper advertising makes sense for the target demographic. The client could concentrate on more social media advertisement campaigns, partnering with influencers etc. This is much cheaper than traditional media and has better traction and returns for those interested in technology. It will also help the company save $4 million on marketing.

**Interviewer**: We will need to check with the client should they be able to renegotiate and exit the warehouse lease.
Yes, most of our customers are families that are fairly tech savvy.

### Part 2 : Analysis of Variable costs
**Candidate**: I’d like to focus more on the variable cost and contributions.
I can see two main areas of concern:
1.	Why have the variable costs increased by 20%?
2.	The logistics costs have also increased by 25%. Is this due to the implementation of lightning? Or are there other reasons?
3.	Why have the logistics costs increased by 25%?
Do you have additional information to provide?

**Interviewer**: Yes
1.	The client is facing issues in the procurement process, that have been reflected in the increased variable costs. At present supplies are ordered last minutes due to unexpected demand.
2.	The client doesn’t handle logistics directly, they have a third party which has hiked their prices sharply. This is for the regular delivery and not the lightning program, the existing logistics provider opted to handle lightning deliveries without extra cost.
3.	The client is also evaluating alternative logistics providers and has provided the following:

|Provider A|	Provider B|	Provider C|
| --- | ---| --- |
|$ 8 Million for 400,000 units, pro-rated cost after volume exceeded|	$ 9 million for 400,000. 10% discount after 450,000. Pro-rated costs after volume exceeded|	$10 million for 400,000 units. Rates increase with time and distance. Prorated after volume exceeded|


**Candidate**:
I see.  I think the client could work on:
1.	Their issues seem to be demand forecasting, and supply chain management. If things are ordered at the last minute, it’s probably due to mistimed demand. There is a corollary to this as over procurement could lead to wasted inventory which could clog the warehouses. The client should consider centralizing or digitizing the system and make use of predictive analytics and AI to improve demand forecasting and efficiency. 
2.	Analyzing the price per unit we get:

|Current provider|	A |	B|	C|
|---|---|---|---|
|28.6|	20 |	18 |	25 (minimum)|

Clearly switching to provider B would help us save significant costs. 
The cost
 460,000 * 18 = 8,280,000
Hence Savings 
= 10,000,000 - 8,280,000
= $1,720,000 million

### Part 3: Revenue
**Candidate**: Lastly, I’d like to focus on the declining revenues.
1.	I can see that the average unit price per unit has declined by 10% to 225. Have there been changes in the customer segments, product mix, or so that explains the difference? Do you have a detailed breakdown of the products and sales? Do you have an idea of how our competitor’s price similar products and what differentiates us from them?
2.	The customer’s lifetime value is the exact same at $500, how is the figure calculated? 

**Interviewer**:
These are the figures we have for product, price and volume:

Year 1:
|---|Price |Volume|
| --- | --- | ---|  
|High |300|200,000|
|Low|	200|	200,000|

Year 2:
|---| Price | Volume|
| --- | --- | --- |
|High| 310 | 160,000 |
|Low | 180 |	300,000 |

You are correct in the fact that there is a change in the composition of our product mix. Our high-end product sales have declined by 20% and our lower-end products have gone up to cover the loss of volume but accordingly our average price per unit has gone down. There are no changes to customer segmentation.
This is what our competitor’s price similar products:
|Competitor A	|Competitor B	|Competitor C|
|---|---|---|
|High|	300|	290|	305|
|Low |	160 |	170 |	165 |


The clients’ products are differentiated by high quality, and warranty service, which competitors lack.  Our clients also design their products whereas competitors primarily import products and don’t design them.
**Interviewer**: Regarding customer lifetime, this is an estimate of how much a customer will buy from us. It is a measure calculated by taking the average customer’s total purchases from us adjusted over time.

**Candidate**:
I see that the market is very tight, however I do have some suggestions for improving revenues:
1.	Warranty service is a key point of competitive advantage, the competitors do not provide this. The client could consider monetizing this service or offering options for customers to go for extended warranty options which is popular with electronics.
2.	Additionally, electronics often are purchased together and rarely in isolation, the client could consider introducing loyalty programs and or bundling products and services together for increasing profits. These actions will also boost the customer lifetime value and gain more revenue for the firm.
This will require investments in market research and product design, which should be possible considering the client designs their own products. A 10% increase in CLV can net an additional 23 million over a customer’s lifetime.
Increase in CLV = 460,000 * $50(10% increase) = $23,000,000

### Part 4: Conclusion, risks, further points of interest
**Interviewer**:  Can you provide a summary of your suggestions and provide a recommendation for the client?

**Candidate**:  Of course,
From the cost side I would recommend
1.	Revolve the loan with a lower interest rate, saving up to $1.3 million annual interest payments.
2.	Remove the lightning delivery program and exit the newly rented warehouse to save $1.1 million in rent.
3.	Reorient the marketing strategy to focus on cheaper digital channels for saving costs and improving engagement. This will save $ 4 million.
4.	Invest in a digitized system making use of predictive analytics and AI for demand forecasting and reducing variable costs.
5.	Switch the logistics partner to provider B to save $1.7 million each year.
This gives an estimated cost savings of 8.1 million annually.
From the revenue side, I would recommend:
1.	Charge a premium for providing warranty service or give the option for customers to pay more for extended warranty.
2.	Introduce a loyalty program, and bundle services to increase revenue and improve the customers lifetime value.
This would still leave a sizeable loss of around $20.45 million however, but will help the client turnaround as revenues pickup and costs decrease.

**Interviewer**: Do you foresee any risks with your plan that the client should be prepared for?

**Candidate**: Yes. These are some potential areas of concerns and ways to mitigate them:
1.	It may be difficult to change logistics providers quickly, and there may be disruptions to customer experience when the change is taking place. Being proactive and analyzing the pain points and ahead of time and preparing for them will make it much easier to manage.
2.	Renegotiating the lease agreement on the warehouse may be quite costly, and even if successful will probably lead to layoffs as there will be an excess of workers. Client should be prepared for this scenario.
3.	Introducing an extended warranty system could expose the client to adverse selection, the client will need to rely on its product design and expertise to accurately assess risk premiums and make a profit.

**Interviewer**: Given additional time and information, what are some areas that you could improve upon?

**Candidate**: Given more information, I would like to look into:
1.	Hiring and training process: The client has both over hired and under hired recently, leading to higher salary costs. I would like to go through why the client did the same, and if they could also improve their system to train existing employees in supervisory duties instead of hiring from the market.
2.	Logistics and delivery: The client presently outsources its logistics to third parties. As this is a key component and the client is a market leader, it may be more feasible to handle its own logistics. A study will need to be conducted to determine this.
3.	Product mix: It’s clear that some products are more expensive to make or sell too little. The products should be evaluated, and more analysis should be done to determine what divisions or products should stop being manufactured. This will help fast track the client to profitability.
