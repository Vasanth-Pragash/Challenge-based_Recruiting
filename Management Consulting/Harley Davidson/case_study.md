1.	How would you approach assessing the production costs and determining the break-even point for Harley Davidson's new electric motorcycle?
Interviewee Response:
To assess the production costs and determine the break-even point for Harley Davidson's new electric motorcycle, I would begin by gathering information on all relevant cost components associated with manufacturing the electric motorcycle. This includes direct costs such as materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead.

I'll also consider any additional costs specific to the electric model, such as research and development expenses, marketing costs, and distribution costs. Once I have a comprehensive understanding of these costs, I'll calculate the break-even point by dividing the total fixed costs by the contribution margin per unit, where the contribution margin is the difference between the selling price and variable costs.

**Next Question**:2. Considering the competitive landscape in the electric motorcycle market, how would you analyze the pricing strategies of key competitors, and what insights would you draw from this analysis for Harley Davidson's pricing strategy?

Additionally, I would analyze customer reviews and feedback on competitors' pricing to gauge consumer perceptions and value perception. Understanding the features and benefits offered by competitors at different price points would provide insights into the perceived value in the market.
This analysis would help Harley Davidson to position its electric motorcycle competitively, considering factors like brand reputation, unique features, and overall market dynamics.

**Next Question**: 3. Given Harley Davidson's strong brand image associated with traditional, loud, and powerful motorcycles, how would you approach aligning the pricing strategy for the new electric motorcycle with the overall brand image and positioning of the company?

Understanding customer perceptions and expectations regarding Harley Davidson's brand values is crucial.

Next, I would explore potential pricing models that resonate with the brand image. For instance, if the electric motorcycle emphasizes innovation and sustainability, a premium pricing strategy could be justified. On the other hand, if the goal is to attract a broader audience and encourage adoption, a more competitive pricing strategy might be suitable.
Additionally, I would evaluate the potential impact of the pricing decision on the perceived value of the brand. Balancing the introduction of a new, sustainable product with the established image of power and performance is essential to maintain customer loyalty.

This could involve targeted focus groups and interviews to capture qualitative data on their expectations and concerns.
Analyzing demographic data, such as age, lifestyle, and geographic location, would also provide insights into how different segments of the Harley Davidson customer base might respond to the introduction of an electric model at various price points.
By aligning the pricing strategy with the preferences of the existing customer base, Harley Davidson can enhance the chances of successful adoption and minimize the risk of alienating loyal customers.

**Next Question**: 5. What pricing models, such as introductory pricing, skimming, or penetration pricing, would you consider for the new electric motorcycle, and what factors would influence your choice?

2.	Skimming Pricing:
•	Definition: Setting a higher initial price to maximize profit from the most willing customers before gradually lowering it.
•	Factors for Consideration: This approach might capitalize on the exclusivity and innovation of the electric motorcycle. However, there's a risk of slower market penetration, especially if competition intensifies.
3.	Penetration Pricing:
•	Definition: Launching the electric motorcycle at a lower price to quickly gain market share.
•	Factors for Consideration: This could stimulate early adoption and establish Harley Davidson in the electric motorcycle market. However, profitability might be a concern, especially if costs are not adequately covered.
The choice among these models would depend on factors such as the competitive landscape, production costs, the company's financial goals, and the desired positioning in the market. It's essential to strike a balance between generating revenue, gaining market share, and maintaining the brand's perceived value.
